title=More Immersive Vehicles
description=Project Zomboid is quite a realistic game, but the developers missed one point. Vehicles in the world appear only with closed doors, raised windows and closed trunks. This mod adds more immersiveness and atmosphere to the game! Vehicles can now have doors open, windows down, or trunks open.
